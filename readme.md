# Glossy Simulator

An implementation of the Glossy algorithm with the Akka framework.

To run the simulator, it is required to install the
[sbt building tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html).  
To run the main program, type on the root project folder `sbt run`.
The program is known to have finished when it prints `GLOSSY_STOP` on the log, after which
you can just halt the execution by pressing the appropriate key combination for your system.
